## intro
let's get to it now. Let me brief you a little bit about myself~ 
- who am i? **Alok** but i am known as "**_ryu_**" on the internet, an ECE|DS undergrad student (what is this place? hell?), 
- where am i from? **Earth**. 
- juggling college together with personal projects like this or Yoru (_secret_) and some professional work over at [IIT Madras](https://github.com/iitm-paradox).  


## what plans do I have in the near future? 
(besides living)

- apart from improving my typing skills, i really want to learn Japanese; enough to understand the words shown in anime.
- improve in Rust and excel in GO. to know about my skill-set; you can simply go [here](https://alokranjan.me/about).
- cybersecurity [ace something like hackthebox].


## interests?

let me not get nerdy here

- I enjoy playing **Badminton** more than anything for now, it is simply bliss for me.
- other than that, I love **cooking**.
- **phonk** makes me feel good.
- learning about tech brings me pleasure.

## projects
i should keep this short so; I'm gonna have to ask you to go [here](https://alokranjan.me/projects)
